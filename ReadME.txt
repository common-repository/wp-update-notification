Many people DO NOT UPDATE Wordpress - since upgrades & updates are important for your security - this will email when updates are available :)

== Description ==
We developed this plugin since we find many, many customers simply DO NOT UPDATE Wordpress regularly. We feel this plugin is a great little solution to notify everyone that upgrades are pending. Regular Wordpress upgrades are very important for your security.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-update-upgrade-notification.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the wp-update-upgrade-notification plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. Go to \'Settings\' -> HackerNinja WP Upgrade Notify
4. Enter your email (and anyone else that should be notified - separated by , (Comma) ) - we recommend at least the website owner, webmaster at least!
5. Select your notification frequency - we recommend daily.

Thats it - click \'Save Settings\' at the bottom and you will be emailed by your blog and the plugin whenever something is ready for an update!

To continue if you wish:
6. If you wish to have free website security monitoring from HackerNinja.com, click the checkbox to register with our service (you will receive emails with instructions afterwards)




Thats it - you are done!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
What do this thing do?

A) This is an extremely simple plugin - but we think something that EVERYONE should have installed :)..  The plugin checks on a daily/weekly/monthly basis for any upgrades/updates to your Wordpress installation.  If there are any - it emails the addresses you specify :)


Q) How this work?

A) Using the internal wp-cron service - built in - no hacks, nothing special :)


Q) Why did you make this?

A) We created this since over half of our Wordpress customers who are hacked, infected or otherwise in trouble - DO NOT update/upgrade their Wordpress.  For many reasons - it just doesn\'t get done.  We feel a simple email reminder service just can\'t go wrong :)


Q) What does the \'free scan\' thing do?

A) Well, we are in the business of cleaning malware, hosting Wordpress and Joomla sites in high performance configurations.  We offer free malware, security, hostile string and AV scanning for everyone who wants it - no commitment and no pressure.  So we included it here on the plugin as well!


Q) What does the security scan do?

A) Major details are here: http://www.hackerninja.com/products/free-web-security-malware-scan/ -  but in a nut shell:
- Full scan of ALL URLs (instead of just a few!)
- Full report of all issues found
- Confirmation with Google Webmaster for Malware status
- Full php code scan, html code scan, Javascript code scan, Linked-to Websites Scan and malicious Code Insertions Scan
- Lifetime daily scanning – Free!
- Constant – by the minute – Google SafeBrowsing Monitoring
- Full and Complete Anti-virus scan – using 3 different engines!

Q) Do you guys offer other stuff I can use?
A) We are launching several other plugins shortly - so signup for our free monitoring service or join our facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hacker-Ninja/346589752350

Q) So what about this hosting thing?

A) So this is a big conversation, but essentially we are providing an uber hardened, uber fast, and uber secure - and fully managed as well - Wordpress/Joomla/Magneto hosting service.  For further details - check out: http://www.hackerninja.com
